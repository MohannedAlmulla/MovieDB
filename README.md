# MovieDB
Swift code for Movie application using The MovieDB




# Time to Finish the Project:
2 days



# I use the following Technologies: 
1. Swift
2. JSON Viewer
3. cocoapods




# I choose swift because:
I'm not familiar with the API process so in order to make the assignment I choose to challenge my self by using something more interesting for me which is coding in swift. In Summary, I'm new to both fields swift and API, and learning something completely new for me were good experience.


# To execute my assignment you need to run the program.
