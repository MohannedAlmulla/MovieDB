# MovieDB
Swift code for Movie application using The MovieDB




# Time to Finish the Project:
2 days



# I use the following Technologies: 
1. Swift
2. JSON Viewer
3. cocoapods




# I choose swift because:
I'm not familiar with the API process so in order to make the assignment I choose to challenge my self by using something more interesting for me which is coding in swift. I complete to days of searching and planing my algorithm to make my coding smoother before I start In Summary, I'm new to both fields swift and API, and learning something completely new for me were good experience.


# To execute my assignment you need to run the program.
